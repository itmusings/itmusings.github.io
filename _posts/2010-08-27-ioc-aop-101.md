I had given a keynote in a conference sometime ago, about the Spring framework. It constituted a presentation on the patterns that necessitated the creation of Spring in the first place. I am attaching a slide deck on this. I would add some more material here as we go to elaborate on the content of the deck.

Here is the deck.[DIAOP](/images/2010/08/DIAOP.ppt)
